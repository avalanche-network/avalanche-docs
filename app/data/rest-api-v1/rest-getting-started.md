Avalanche Network uses a *restfull API* to communicate with other apps. The *API* entry point can be found in the following url:

    http://avalanche.network/api/

Some of the *endpoints* are public, depending on the data being queried. Other *endpoints* require authentication. An example public *endpoint* is:

    http://avalanche.network/api/missions

Accessing the URL above will return a *JSON* file with the last 10 public launched missions on the Avalanche Network database.
